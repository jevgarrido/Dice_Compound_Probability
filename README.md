# Compound Probability of Dice Roll

Problem:
    Find the Discrete Probability Density Function associated with multiple dice roll

Inputs:
    Number of dice, n;
    Number of faces in each die, f.
  
Output:
    Plot of the normalized histogram associated with the roll.

The function is called as "dice_probability_main(n, f)", introducing the desired arguments n and f.


## Example for n = 4 and f = 6
