# Compound Probability of Dice Roll

Problem:
    Find the (discrete) Probability Density Function associated with multiple dice roll

Inputs:
    Number of dice, n;
    Number of faces in each die, f.
  
Output:
    Plot of the normalized histogram associated with the roll.
  
Language:
    MATLAB

To run the solver just call the function "dice_probability_main(n, f)", setting the desired arguments n and f.
